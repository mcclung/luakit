--- Miscellaneous UI and statusbar widgets.
--
-- This module provides a set of builtin user interface widgets used to
-- construct the Luakit user interface, as well as a set of widgets that can be
-- added to the luakit status bar.
--
-- # Widget types:
--
-- - `buf`: A status bar widget that displays the contents of the current key
-- binding input buffer. When typing a multi-key key binding, such as `gi`, this
-- widget will show the partially-typed key binding.
-- - `hist`: A status bar widget that indicates whether the current tab can be
-- navigated forwards or backwards. Backwards page history is indicated
-- with a `+`, while forwards page history is indicated with a `-`.
-- - `menu`: A widget that shows a scrollable menu. This widget type is
-- used in the default luakit user interface.
-- - `progress`: A status bar widget that shows the current page load
-- progress as a percentage while a load is underway. The progress
-- indicator is hidden when no page load is taking place.
-- - `scroll`: A status bar widget that shows the current vertical scroll
-- position of the current web page, as a percentage.
-- - `ssl`: A status bar widget that shows whether the current web page was
-- loaded over a secure connection. If the page was loaded securely,
-- `(trust)` is shown in green; otherwise, `(notrust)` is shown in red.
-- - `tabi`: A status bar that shows the number of the currently selected tab,
-- as well as the total number of tabs in the window.
-- - `tablist`: A widget that displays a set of `tab` widgets in a scrollable
-- window. This widget type is used in the default luakit user interface.
-- - `tablist`: A widget that displays the clickable "handle" attached to a tab.
-- This widget type is used in the default luakit user interface.
-- - `uri`: A status bar widget that displays the URI of the current web page.
